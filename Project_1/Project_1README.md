# Tooter game
This is a project made for UCLA CS32. This Tooter game is a terminal based video game implementing common OOP principles such as classes, control flow, and dynamic allocation.

# How to play
In this game, you are the player '@', and are surrounded my enemies called Tooters. If Tooters are either Left, Right, Up, or Down from you, they fart, taking away a life (I know the game is silly, I did not come up with the idea). To fight back, you can purify each Tooter that is on one of the 8 squares adjacent to you by pressing space, but you only have a 1/3 success rate. You can also move the player around using the arrow keys. If there are more than one Tooter per square, they appear as a Number rather than a T.

# How to use
